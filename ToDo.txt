# ToDo List:

# Add a function to change any of the self values (BPM, amplitude, offset, period etc.) 
    # To do this you likely need the ability to have multiple functions running at once
    # This is where you need ROS


# Get the robot to walk in a line forward backwards 
# Get the robot to walk in a circle 
# Start doing motion such as walking in circle or line or spinning on the spot or jumping
